# jsondiff.py - an almost smart enough JSON diff tool
#
# This program does line-by-line diffs of two files with one JSON blob
# per line, outputting one color-coded HTML diff per line into a target
# directory. It performs a text diff on alphabetized, pretty printed
# JSON. That's good enough for JSON blobs that have similar structure,
# or dissimilar values (arrays of single digit numbers, for example, can
# cause confusion, because one 7 looks like every other 7).
#
# A smarter (future) version would intelligently diff the structure of
# the JSON, but the goal here was to put something reasonable together
# as quickly as possible.
#
# It has a number of hacks specific to diffing JSON from CirrusSearch
# results, including removing "searchmatch" markup and bolding elements
# that are most important in comparing results, and numbering results.
